# GreenCart Logistics Simulation & Management Platform

## 1. Project Overview & Purpose

GreenCart Logistics is an internal tool designed for an eco-friendly delivery company to simulate delivery operations, analyze key performance indicators (KPIs), and manage core data entities such as drivers, routes, and orders. The platform enables:

- Running delivery simulations based on configurable parameters.
- Viewing summarized KPIs like total profit, efficiency, on-time delivery rates, and fuel costs.
- Managing operational data through CRUD interfaces for Drivers, Routes, and Orders.
- Tracking simulation history with detailed KPI results.

This project aims to optimize logistics operations and enhance decision-making by providing actionable insights and real-time data management.
